    "Our bond issue data has quite a few variables, but location is not one of them (not even states).  To associate these bond issues with the right counties, we need to grab the coordinates of each issuer.  In this Notebook, we will leverage the [Google Maps API for Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/apis/mapsengine/v1?hl=en) to capture lat-long info.  To do so, we need a new project in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project), and once this is created, we can enable any Google API we need.  In this case, we need the *Google Maps Geocoding API*.\n",
